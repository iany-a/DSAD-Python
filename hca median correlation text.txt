Your dendrogram for the variables tells a very clear story about the lifestyle patterns in your dataset.

In a variable dendrogram using metric='correlation', the vertical axis represents dissimilarity. Variables that "join" lower down are highly correlated (they move together), while those that join high up are independent or move in opposite ways.

Here is how to interpret your specific graph for your project report:
1. The "Physical Strain" Cluster (Far Left)

Look at the orange cluster on the left. Physical Activity Level and Daily Steps join almost at the bottom (near 0.2).

    Interpretation: These two are nearly identical in your data. If someone has high steps, they almost always have a high activity level.

    Relation to Health: Notice they eventually join with Occupation_Lawyer. In your dataset, this suggests that Lawyers might have a very distinct, consistent physical activity pattern compared to other professions.

2. The "Vital Signs" Cluster (Middle)

In the center-left, you see Stress Level and Heart Rate grouping together.

    Interpretation: This is a strong physiological link. High stress levels in your data are directly correlated with an increased heart rate.

    The "Stability" Threshold: These join Occupation_Doctor. This indicates that Doctors in your dataset share a specific "profile" of high stress and high heart rate.

3. The "Physical Health" Cluster (Middle-Right)

Look at Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure. They are grouped almost at zero.

    Interpretation: This is perfect! It proves your "Blood Pressure" split worked. Since they are part of the same measurement, they should be perfectly correlated.

    Correlation with BMI: They join with BMI Category next. This shows a direct link in your data between higher weight categories and higher blood pressure.

4. The "Sleep Quality" Cluster

Sleep Duration and Quality of Sleep join very low (near 0.1) with Occupation_Engineer.

    Interpretation: For Engineers in your study, the length of sleep and the quality of sleep are extremely tied together. This group likely has very consistent sleep patterns.

Key Takeaway for your Project

The red line is the Threshold calculated by your professor's utl.threshold(h) function.

    It has "cut" the variables into three main pillars (the blue, orange, and green branches).

    When you write your report, you can say: "The Hierarchical Analysis identified three primary 'factors' in the data: (1) Physical Activity, (2) Cardiovascular/Stress markers, and (3) Sleep/Demographic characteristics."

Next Step: PCA

Since your dendrogram shows that many variables are doing the "same job" (like Steps and Activity), this is the perfect justification for PCA.

You can tell your professor: "Because the HCA showed high correlation between variables like Daily Steps and Physical Activity, I used PCA to reduce this redundancy into a single principal component."
